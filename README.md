# CommandBotFramework
The goal of the CommandBotFramework is to make an generic system which can be used to create bots for multiple platforms  while using the same commands. I started this project in order for a few Twitch streamers, who also have a Discord community, to have consistent commands over their platforms.

## Setting up the project
### Requirements
 - IDE (Jetbrains Rider, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)
 - .NET Core 3.1
 
### Steps
1. Clone the repo.
2. Build the solution.
3. Use CommandBotFramework.ManualTest to open a "chat" terminal in order to test your changes.
